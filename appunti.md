3) Multivariate Analysis (Escape Flatland)
The analysis of cause and effect, initially bivariate, quickly became multivariate, though such necessary elaboration as the conditions under which the causal relation holds, interaction effects, multiple causes, multiple effects, causal sequencies, suorces of bias, spurious correlation, suorces of measurement error, competing variables, and whether the alleged cause is merely a proxy or a marker variable.

### p.130

Flatlandy technologies of display encourage flatlandy thinking.
Strategies of design should make multivariateness routine, nothing out the ordinary,
To think multivariate, show multivariate.
Show multivariate data: that is, show more than 1 or 2 variables.

4) Integration of evidence
The evidence doesn't care what it is - wheter word, number, image. In reasoning about substantive problems what matters entirely is the evidence, not *particular modes* of evidence.
